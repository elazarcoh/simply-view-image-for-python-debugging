# GitHub Workflow Improvements for Better Test Inspection

This document describes the enhancements made to the `.github/workflows/test.yml` workflow to provide better test result inspection capabilities based on the reference workflow from `redhat-developer/vscode-extension-tester-example`.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Enhanced Test Artifact Collection

**Before:**

- Basic test results upload to `test/out/` directory
- Limited visibility into test failure details

**After:**

- **Test Results** (always uploaded): Compiled tests and configuration files
- **Test Logs** (uploaded on failure/cancellation): Detailed logs from vscode-extension-tester
- **Screenshots** (uploaded on failure/cancellation): Visual evidence of test failures

### 2. Predictable Artifact Locations

- Modified test command to use `--storage test-resources` for consistent artifact paths
- Added `/test-resources/` to `.gitignore` to prevent committing test artifacts
- All artifacts are now stored in predictable locations relative to the project root

### 3. Status Check Job

Added a comprehensive status check job that:

- Monitors results from test, build, and security jobs
- Provides clear success/failure indicators
- Shows detailed status information for debugging
- Runs always, even if other jobs fail

### 4. Maintained Existing Functionality

- Kept Ubuntu-only testing (no OS matrix as requested)
- Preserved all existing build steps unchanged
- Tests continue to work exactly as before
- No breaking changes to the development workflow

## Artifact Details

### Test Results (Always Uploaded)

```
out/tests/                    # Compiled test files
test-resources/settings/      # VS Code test configuration
test-resources/*.json         # Test metadata and configuration
```

### Test Logs (Failure/Cancellation Only)

```
test-resources/settings/logs/* # Detailed test execution logs
test-resources/*.log          # Additional log files
```

### Screenshots (Failure/Cancellation Only)

```
test-resources/screenshots/*.png  # Test failure screenshots
test-resources/**/*.png          # Any other generated screenshots
```

## Benefits for Test Inspection

1. **Better Debugging**: Logs and screenshots provide detailed context for test failures
2. **Web-based Inspection**: All artifacts accessible directly in GitHub web interface
3. **Automated Collection**: No manual intervention required to gather diagnostic information
4. **Focused Uploads**: Only failure-related artifacts uploaded when tests fail to save space
5. **Status Overview**: Clear summary of all job results in a single status check

## Usage

When tests fail, inspect the artifacts in the GitHub Actions run:

1. Check the "logs-ubuntu-latest" artifact for detailed execution logs
2. Check the "screenshots-ubuntu-latest" artifact for visual evidence of failures
3. Use the "test-results" artifact for test configuration and metadata
4. Review the status check job for a quick overview of what failed

## Compatibility

- Fully compatible with existing development workflow
- No changes required to local development setup
- Maintains all existing functionality while adding enhanced inspection capabilities
