   By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
   to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
   Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
   extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
   granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
   these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
   consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
   Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

   Section 1 - Definitions.
    a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
       Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and
       in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged,
       transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission
       under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For
       purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a
       musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
       always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed
       relation with a moving image.
    b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
       Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
       accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
    c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
       closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
       performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
       Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
       categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
       specified in Section [5]2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
       Rights.
    d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
       absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
       fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
       Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
       agreements.
    e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any
       other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that
       applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.
    f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or
       other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.
    g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
       terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
       all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
       Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
    h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
       under this Public License.
    i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
       process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as
       reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
       dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
       available to the public including in ways that members of the
       public may access the material from a place and at a time
       individually chosen by them.
    j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
       resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
       the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
       as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
       equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
    k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
       under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

   Section 2 - Scope.
    a. License grant.
         1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
            the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
            non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
            exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
              A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in
                 part; and
              B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
         2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
            Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
            License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its
            terms and conditions.
         3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
            [6]6(a).
         4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
            Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all
            media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and
            to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
            Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
            authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
            necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical
            modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
            Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making
            modifications authorized by this Section [7]2(a)(4) never
            produces Adapted Material.
         5. Downstream recipients.
              A. Offer from the Licensor - Licensed Material. Every
                 recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives
                 an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed
                 Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public
                 License.
              B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                 any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                 apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                 Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                 Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                 Material.
         6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
            may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
            are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
            with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
            the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
            provided in Section [8]3(a)(1)(A)(i).
    b. Other rights.
         1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed
            under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or
            other similar personality rights; however, to the extent
            possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any
            such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent
            necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but
            not otherwise.
         2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public
            License.
         3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
            collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
            Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under
            any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing
            scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any
            right to collect such royalties.

   Section 3 - License Conditions.

   Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
   following conditions.
    a. Attribution.
         1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
            form), You must:
              A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                 with the Licensed Material:
                   i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                      Material and any others designated to receive
                      attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                      the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);
                  ii. a copyright notice;
                  iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
                  iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                      warranties;
                   v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                      extent reasonably practicable;
              B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain
                 an indication of any previous modifications; and
              C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                 Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                 hyperlink to, this Public License.
         2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section [9]3(a)(1) in any
            reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
            which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
            reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
            hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
            information.
         3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
            information required by Section [10]3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
            reasonably practicable.
         4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
            License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
            Material from complying with this Public License.

   Section 4 - Sui Generis Database Rights.

   Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
   apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section [11]2(a)(1) grants You the
       right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
       portion of the contents of the database;
    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
       contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
       Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
       Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section [12]3(a) if You
       Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [13]4 supplements and does not
   replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
   Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

   Section 5 - Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
    a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the
       extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is
       and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any
       kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied,
       statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties
       of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
       non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
       the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or
       discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in
       full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.
    b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to
       You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
       or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
       consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs,
       expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of
       the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
       possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a
       limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this
       limitation may not apply to You.

    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
       above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
       possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
       waiver of all liability.

   Section 6 - Term and Termination.
    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
       Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
       this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
       terminate automatically.
    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
       Section [14]6(a), it reinstates:
         1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
            it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation;
            or
         2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
       For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [15]6(b) does not affect
       any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your
       violations of this Public License.
    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
       Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
       distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
       will not terminate this Public License.
    d. Sections [16]1, [17]5, [18]6, [19]7, and [20]8 survive termination
       of this Public License.

   Section 7 - Other Terms and Conditions.
    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
       terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
       Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
       independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

   Section 8 - Interpretation.
    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall
       not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
       conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
       be made without permission under this Public License.
    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
       deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
       cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
       without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
       conditions.
    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
       failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
       Licensor.
    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as
       a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that
       apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of
       any jurisdiction or authority.
